## Project 1: Default of Credit Card Default 

We used the data set to predict whether the credit card holders are defaulters or Non-defaulters. The Dataset and its attributes are described below

ID: ID of each client

LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit

SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)

EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)

MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)

AGE: Age in years

PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months,8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)

PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)

BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)

## Project 2 : Khyposis Risk Factors

Data were collected on 81 patients undergoing corrective spinal surgery (Bell et al., 1989). The objective was to determine important risk factors for kyphosis following surgery. The risk factors are age in years, the starting vertebrae level of the surgery and the number of levels involved.

Following steps were done in the project :

Load the dataset and print the metadata in the notebook and printed a heatmap to check NULL values and  printed a pairplot of the dataset.

Performed splitting of train and test data and feature scaling on independent variables .

We build a classifier model using AdaBoost Classifier algorithm and printed classification report and plotted confusion matrix and determined the stratified cross validation accuracy .
